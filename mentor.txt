3) I decided to use PostCSS instead of preprocessors, as it becomes more efficient and handy.

1. Since you've started to use ES6 in the previous homework I suggest to use it further.
For example, arrow functions, property shorthand, destructuring etc.
2. It's better to store all constants (e.g. 'isObservable', 'change', '[data-bind]' etc) as variables at the top of your code.
It's useful during your code maintenance.
3. Just a suggestion: try to use TDD during development.
It's very useful and helps other developers to understand what your code does.

1. Stylistic minor: please use brackets arround single parameter in arrow functions.
2. Please move string constants to top of your code. 
3. Make password encrypted - it's necessary for authentication functionality.
