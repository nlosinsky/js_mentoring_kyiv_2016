# Quick start

1. You have to install `cordova` and `ios-sim` packages. For Xcode 7+, please, enter `npm install -g cordova`, otherwise  - `npm install -g cordova@5`. To allow the application to be opened on IOS Simulator you should enter `npm install -g ios-sim`.
2. In a project root run `npm run setup`. It will install all dependencies including some required global packages.
3. To install typescript interfaces run `npm run typings`.
4. To run an application run `npm run app:cordova-unix`. 

NOTE: The application can be launched on the IOS Simulator on Mac OS X only.
